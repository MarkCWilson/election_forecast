<h1>Election forecasting</h1>
Election forecasting is a popular activity. There are many models, some
of which look only at polling data, while others incorporate data on
``fundamentals" such as inflation and unemployment rates. One problem in
evaluation and production of forecasts is that high-stakes elections are
relatively rare, so getting enough data can be tricky.
<p>
I have studied electoral systems and their performance on synthetic
data. Here we are talking instead about prediction of elections using
real data.
<p>
This collection of data science projects will evolve as I get more time to work on them. 
The key
data and code can be found on <a
